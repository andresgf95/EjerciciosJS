/**
 * Objects are very important data types in programming.
 * For now, we only will use object for storing values
 * grouped by lavels or names called "properties". But objects are
 * very more complexes and powerfulls.
 * The onject properties of a objects describes the nature of a "thing".
 * Each property can store any kind of data: numbers, strings or ever arrays
 * or other objects.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * let teacher = {
 *   name: "Daniel",
 *   age: 25,
 *   enrolled: true,
 *   ageIsReliable: false,
 * }
 * 
 * Exercise:
 * - Declare a variable named "pet" and assign to it an
 * object with the properties "name", "species", "birthYear" and "friendly".
 * - Assign values "KitKat", "cat", 1983 and true to the properties.
